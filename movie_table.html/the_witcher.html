         <h2>Production</h2>   
             <p>
                
In September 2021 at Tudum: A Netflix Global Fan Event, Netflix first announced development of a second anime feature film following The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf.[1] In the following months, executive producer Tomek Baginski stated that the film would be directly based on a work by Andrzej Sapkowski in The Witcher series as opposed to creating a new story from material Sapkowski hints at throughout the series.[2] This was later revealed to be the short story "A Little Sacrifice" from Sword of Destiny when Netflix also revealed the title The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep in a teaser trailer. Netflix collaborated with South Korean animation Studio Mir, Studio IAM and Platige Image and Hivemind, as they had with Nightmare of the Wolf.[3] The announcement also included a 2024 release and the cast. After Henry Cavill left the series, Doug Cockle returned to voice Geralt of Rivia as he had in the video game series. Joey Batey and Anya Chalotra would reprise their roles from the live-action series, and Christina Wren joined the cast.[4] The film was eventually delayed to February 11, 2025.[5]
